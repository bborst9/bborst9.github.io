		<h2>Anticipation Mole</h2>
		<p>This animation was created to show anticipation. Anticipation plays a major role in a succesful animaiton. The artwok is completely original and created and drawn by myself using a drawing tablet and photoshop and then those images were composited in After Effects and animated to produce this final video. This video is supposed to replicate the "whack-a-mole" arcade game.</p>

		<h2>Shadow</h2>
		<p>This short animation was created because of my love for scary movies. I wanted to create a creepy yet intriguing animation, and came up with the idea of Shadow. The artwork is all original and created using a drawing tablet and Photoshop and composited in After Effects. This is one of my most succesful animations to come out of Photoshop and After Effects.</p>

		<h2>Muybridge</h2>
		<p>This animation was created to teach me and show cycles of animation. Muybridge would take contiuous photographs different people, animals, and objects performing different tasks and then would piece them together to create a stop-motion animation. I took one of those muybridge photograph cycles and recreated it in an animation. I decided to do a bit of artwork on top of it and made a looping jousting animation. All the artwork was created in Photoshop and composited in After Efffects.</p>

		<h2>Lightsaber Training</h2>
		<p>This is the first animation I have created in Cinema 4D. 3D animation is definitely my favorite form of art an wish to continue it in my future. This animation also shows my love for star wars and shows a little jedi training. All art was created by myself in Cinema 4D.</p>
