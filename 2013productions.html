        <h2>Bank Heist</h2>
        <p>This is a project that I had completed for my Intermediate Video for Interactive Media class. The project itself was to shoot video on a green screen and then edit it in anyway possible. This is the second video I have had to edit on a green screen and I produced the idea of the bank heist because I love to make things blow up and I wanted to create something that was going to be a challenge. My professor aided in shooting the video and gave me some ideas to really push my creativeness to a new level. I spent many hours researching and watching tutorials on how to create different effects. The result was this 30 second clip. This project has really boosted my knowledge in after effects, and with it I will be able to create many more creative projects. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Shakespeare's Sonnet 146</h2>
        <p>This is a project that I had completed for my Intermediate Video for Interactive Media class. The project itself was to chose one of Shakespeares sonnets and create a kinetic typogrphic video for it. The grunge/rock wall idea that I came up with for this project came from the line in the sonnet that reads, "Why so large cost, having so short a lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?" The english translation of this is, "Why such expenditure when the lease on your crumbling mansion is so short?"<br>The project itself took many hours to create. I started by creating each line crumble away in different compositions after that I recorded and altered the audio, and matched it up with the crumbling of the text. After creating a composition for each of the 14 lines I combined them all in a single composition, added a vignette, a camera, and a light the flickers. All of that together and 9 hours of rendering created this final composition.</p>

        <h2>Lightning Strike</h2>
        <p>This is a project that I had completed for my Intermediate Video for Interactive Media class. The project itself was to shoot video on a green screen and then edit it in anyway possible. We had to have multiple moving parts to the shot, but it was also the first time I had shoot video on a green screen and the expectations were to just produce a piece that was fluent. I got the idea of the thunderstorm scene because after tinkering with After Effects I noticed there were a lot of built in presets with lightning and rain and figured that I could use those to create a very real thunderstorm. Since I have a personal interest in blood and gore I added an explosion factor that really sells the video. The project itself was shot by myself and edited by myself completely in after effects. I hope to take what I have learned in this video and apply to many more. Enjoy!</p>
