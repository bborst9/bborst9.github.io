        <h1>About Brian Borst</h1>
        <div class="shape" id="shape1"></div>
        <p>My name is Brian Borst and I am a senior at Bradley University studying Interactive Media focusing in Animation and Visual Effects. I grew up loving to build things and always imagined taking after my dad who is a structural engineer. I came to Bradley as an engineer and after a year realized I would not make it as an engineer for the rest of my life. I have a creative side to me that I could not express as an engineer, which lead me to interactive media. I was unaware of the interactive media major when I switched to it, but the few classes I took I couldn’t get enough of it. I love design and making different compositions digitally. In my future I want to work in movies. I want to work in a production studio with a team and create the most visually appealing art for people to enjoy. I am a movie fanatic and think that what is done in movies is amazing and I want to learn how to recreate it. Besides animation I spend a lot of time listening to music. It has always been a desire of mine to be in a band, but know the chances of that are slim. I spend my free time studying and learning about music and when I’m not watching movies I’m listening to music. Lyrics are important to me and have spoken to me in many ways and lead me to where I am today. I strive to work hard and create the best work that will land me a job in the coming year.</p>
